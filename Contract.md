**Investor**: [Investor Name], located at [Investor Address], ("Investor")

### 1. Purpose
The purpose of this contract is to provide the Homebuyer with down payment assistance in exchange for the Investor’s participation in the appreciation (or depreciation) of the home’s equity. The Homebuyer retains full ownership rights and responsibilities, while the Investor receives a share of the appreciation based on their equity contribution.

- **Equity Shares**: The Investor initially owns [20%] equity, and the Homebuyer owns [7.5%]. The remaining [72.5%] is financed through a mortgage.

### 3. Equity Evaluation & Appreciation Calculation
The equity shares of both the Homebuyer and the Investor will be re-evaluated monthly using a **Smoothed Market Estimate** based on:
- **Nearby Home Sales**: A weighted average of sales from comparable properties in the local area over the last 12 months.
- **Market Trends**: Regional and national real estate market indices.
- **Home Condition**: Adjustments based on the home's condition as reflected in any significant repairs, upgrades, or major maintenance, verified through an independent appraiser if needed.
- **5-Year Appraisal**: To enhance the accuracy of monthly equity evaluations, an independent appraisal will be conducted every five (5) years to determine the home’s market value. This appraisal will be used to adjust the Smoothed Market Estimate for greater precision.

#### Equity Calculation Process
1. **Home Value Estimation**: The home’s estimated value is re-evaluated monthly using market data, including nearby comparable sales, real estate trends, and the most recent appraisal.
   
2. **Homebuyer’s Equity**: The Homebuyer’s equity increases as they pay down the mortgage principal. The Homebuyer receives appreciation (or depreciation) only on the value of their equity contribution (i.e., their down payment and mortgage payments).
   - **Homebuyer Equity** = Homebuyer’s Down Payment + Mortgage Principal Paid.
   
3. **Investor’s Equity**: The Investor receives appreciation (or depreciation) on the remainder of the home value, calculated as:
   - **Investor’s Equity** = Investor’s Down Payment + Appreciation on Unpaid Mortgage Value.

4. **Equity Share Calculation**: The Homebuyer and Investor’s equity shares are calculated as a percentage of the home’s current value.
5. **Depreciation Protection**: In the event of depreciation, the Homebuyer and Investor’s equity shares will be adjusted proportionally based on their current shares and the new home value. Both parties bear the risk of depreciation.
6. **Depreciation Due to Negligence**: If depreciation is due to the Homebuyer’s negligence or failure to maintain the property, the Homebuyer may be liable for the full amount of depreciation.

#### Monthly Equity Share Adjustment:
- Each month, the home’s current value is determined, and the respective equity shares of the Homebuyer and the Investor are updated accordingly.
- **Homebuyer’s Appreciation/Depreciation**: The Homebuyer only receives appreciation or depreciation on the value of their equity contribution.
- **Investor’s Appreciation/Depreciation**: The Investor receives appreciation or depreciation on their portion of the home’s value, including the mortgage-financed portion.
- In the event of depreciation, the Homebuyer’s and Investor’s equity will be adjusted proportionally based on their current shares and the new home value. Both parties bear the risk of depreciation.

### 4. Home Improvement Fund (HIF)
- **Contributions**: The Homebuyer must contribute 0.1% of the home’s value per month to the Home Improvement Fund (HIF). 
- **Ownership of HIF**: The HIF is owned jointly by the Homebuyer and Investor in proportion to their current equity shares.
- **Usage**: Funds can be used for necessary repairs, maintenance, or improvements. Major renovations require Investor approval, but minor repairs can be executed by the Homebuyer at their discretion. In the case of a disagreement over the use of the HIF, an independent third-party inspector may be hired (jointly funded by both parties) to assess the necessity and cost of the improvements. The inspector’s recommendation will be binding.
- **Distribution**: Upon the sale of the home or buyout of the Investor, the HIF is distributed in proportion to the Homebuyer and Investor’s current equity shares.
