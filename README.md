# HEAP - Home Equity Appreciation Partnership
Down Payment Assistance for Homebuyers in exchange for<br/>
Amplified Participation in appreciation of Home Equity for Investors.


### Contract
* The homebuyer receives a large down payment (e.g. 20% of the home value) from the investor while still paying a smaller down payment (e.g. 7.5%)
* With a cumulative down payment of 27.5%, the homebuyer can afford a mortgage with a lower interest rate and monthly payment
* The investor starts off with the equity of their down payment (20%) and the homebuyer starts off with the equity of their down payment (7.5%)
* As the home appreciates, the homebuyer only receives appreciation on the money they have paid into equity (7.5% + equity payments on their mortgage)
* The investor receives the remainder of the appreciation on the home (their portion plus that owned by the bank)
* The homebuyer retains 100% ownership rights and responsibilities of the home

### Clarifications
* The homebuyer owes nothing to the investor
* The investor cannot force the homebuyer to sell the home
* The investor cannot foreclose on the homebuyer
* The investor cannot dictate when the home is sold
* The investor cashes out one of three ways:
  * The homebuyer sells the home
  * The investor sells their contract (rights to the appreciation) to another investor
  * The investor eventually sells back some or all of their contract to the homebuyer
* The investor does not pay property taxes, insurance, or maintenance on the home
* Certain value-changing events (e.g. home improvements such as remodels) may lead to a re-adjustment of equity
  * If the homebuyer remodels with their own money, they may receive a larger share of the appreciation
  * If the investor offers to pay for a remodel and the homebuyer agrees, the investor may receive a larger share of the appreciation


### Results
* The homebuyer is able to afford to buy and live in a home they otherwise couldn't afford
* The investor beats the real estate market due to their amplified participation in the appreciation of the home
  * If the market goes up 4% per year, the investor would make ~8% per year on their investment over the 30 year term
  * This is competitive with the stock market and also competitive with buying a home and renting it out
* The contract hopefully has a net positive effect on society and the economy by increasing home ownership rates and reducing wealth inequality
* The contract is a win-win for both parties and is a much better deal than renting for the homebuyer
