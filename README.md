# HEAP - Home Equity Appreciation Partnership
Down Payment Assistance for Homebuyers in exchange for<br/>
Amplified Participation in appreciation of Home Equity for Investor.

## Base Contract
#### Basics
* The homebuyer receives a large down payment (e.g. 20% of the home value) from the investor while still paying a smaller down payment (e.g. 7.5%)
* With a cumulative down payment of 27.5%, the homebuyer can afford a mortgage with a lower interest rate and monthly payment
* The investor starts off with the equity of their down payment (20%) and the homebuyer starts off with the equity of their down payment (7.5%)
* As the home appreciates, the homebuyer only receives appreciation on the money they have paid into equity (7.5% + equity payments on their mortgage)
* The investor receives the remainder of the appreciation on the home (their portion plus that owned by the bank)
* The homebuyer retains 100% ownership rights and responsibilities of the home with a few minor exceptions
* The homebuyer is responsible for all property taxes, insurance, and maintenance on the home
* The homebuyer OWES NOTHING to the investor (they have no debt to the investor whatsoever, BUT they do not own 100% of the home, even after the mortgage is paid off)
* The investor CANNOT foreclose on the homebuyer or force the homeowner to sell the home

### Goals
* The homebuyer is able to afford to buy and live in a home they otherwise couldn't afford
* The investor beats the real estate market due to their amplified participation in the appreciation of the home
  * If the market goes up 4% per year, the investor would make ~8% per year on their investment over the 30 year term
  * This is competitive with the stock market and also competitive with buying a home and renting it out
* The contract hopefully has a net positive effect on society and the economy by increasing home ownership rates and reducing wealth inequality
* The contract is a win-win for both parties and is a much better deal than renting for the homebuyer

#### Home Improvement Fund
* In order to ensure the home is maintained, the homebuyer is required to make monthly payments of 0.1% of the home value (1.2%/year) into a Home Improvement Fund 
  * The HIF is jointly owned by the homebuyer and the investor at the same ratio as the equity in the home
  * The HIF can be used for qualifying home maintenance, repairs, and improvements at the discretion of the homebuyer

## HEAP Joint Investment Fund
Instead of a single investor, the down payment can be funded by a group of investors, and similarly a single investor can split their investment among multiple homebuyers.

### Advantages
* When spreading out an investment among multiple homes, the risks (defaulting on the mortgage, home fires, home depreciation, etc.) are spread out among multiple homes
* By spreading out an investment among multiple homes, the returns are more predictable and less volatile
* The base contract has an uneven rate of return, with high risks and high reqards at the beginning of the contract, and lower risks and lower rewards at the end of the contract
* By spreading out an investment among multiple homes, the risks and rewards are more evenly distributed over time

In the event of a default, the bank forecloses on the home. 
The investor will receive their share of the proceeds from the sale of the home, but it will likely be less than the value of the home.
