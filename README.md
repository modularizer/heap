# HEAP - Home Equity Appreciation Partnership
Down Payment Assistance for Homebuyers in exchange for<br/>
Amplified Participation in appreciation of Home Equity for Investors.


### Contract
* The homebuyer receives a large down payment (e.g. 20% of the home value) from the investor while still paying a smaller down payment (e.g. 7.5%)
* With a cumulative down payment of 27.5%, the homebuyer can afford a mortgage with a lower interest rate and monthly payment
* The investor starts off with the equity of their down payment (20%) and the homebuyer starts off with the equity of their down payment (7.5%)
* As the home appreciates, the homebuyer only receives appreciation on the money they have paid into equity (7.5% + equity payments on their mortgage)
* The investor receives the remainder of the appreciation on the home (their portion plus that owned by the bank)
* The homebuyer retains 100% ownership rights and responsibilities of the home

### Clarifications
* The homebuyer owes nothing to the investor
* The investor cannot force the homebuyer to sell the home
* The investor cannot foreclose on the homebuyer
* The investor cannot dictate when the home is sold
* The investor cashes out one of three ways:
  * The homebuyer sells the home
  * The investor sells their contract (rights to the appreciation) to another investor
  * The investor eventually sells back some or all of their contract to the homebuyer
* The investor does not pay property taxes, insurance, or maintenance on the home
* Certain value-changing events (e.g. home improvements such as remodels) may lead to a re-adjustment of equity
  * If the homebuyer remodels with their own money, they may receive a larger share of the appreciation
  * If the investor offers to pay for a remodel and the homebuyer agrees, the investor may receive a larger share of the appreciation


### Results
* The homebuyer is able to afford to buy and live in a home they otherwise couldn't afford
* The investor beats the real estate market due to their amplified participation in the appreciation of the home
  * If the market goes up 4% per year, the investor would make ~8% per year on their investment over the 30 year term
  * This is competitive with the stock market and also competitive with buying a home and renting it out
* The contract hopefully has a net positive effect on society and the economy by increasing home ownership rates and reducing wealth inequality
* The contract is a win-win for both parties and is a much better deal than renting for the homebuyer





A contract between a homebuyer and a real-estate investor which helps the homeowner to afford to buy a home, while simultaneously helping the investor beat the market.

### Example Scenario

#### Homebuyer
- A homebuyer wants to buy a $800k home but can't afford the down payment or monthly mortgage payments.
- The homeowner can only afford a ~$550k mortgage and only has $80k for a down payment
- There are no homes available for $550k in the area
- With only $80k (10%) down on an $800k home, the homeowner would have a high interest rate and high monthly payments ~5k/month

#### Investor
- The investor has plenty of cash and wants to beat the market
- The investor doesn't have much interest in actually owning the home, but is interested in the potential appreciation of the home

### Solution
- The investor contributes $170k to the down payment and the homeowner contributes $80k
- Together, they have a $250k down payment (31%) the homeowner can afford a $550k mortgage with a monthly payment of ~$3.6k/month
- They sign a contract where the investor gets most of the appreciation of the home, but zero ownership rights
- The investor can't dictate when the home is sold, but can sell their rights to the appreciation to another investor
- The homebuyer OWES NOTHING to the investor and has no obligations to them
- The investor cannot foreclose on the homebuyer, force them to sell, or control any aspect of the home
- The investor does not have to pay property taxes, insurance, or maintenance on the home

### Benefits
#### For the investor
- The investor can beat the market by investing in real estate without the hassle of owning a home
- This is because the get most of the appreciation of the home without the downsides of owning a home
- While the investor only put down $170k, they get **most** of the appreciation of the $800k home
- If the real estate market goes up ~4% per year on average the investor would make ~8% per year on their investment over the 30 year term
  - at the end of 30 years, the investor would own ~63% equity in the home. This would stop increasing at that point, but would continue to appreciate at a normal rate

#### For the homeowner
- The homeowner can afford to buy a home they otherwise couldn't afford
- The homeowner finishes the 30 year term with equity worth 961k (800k + ~1-2% appreciation per year) and they have a home they can live in indefinitely
- While they don't fully own the home, they have no debts, obligations, or rent
- This is a MUCH better deal than renting, where they would have no equity at the end of the term

### Risks
- If the real estate market goes down, the investor could lose money at an accelerated rate
- If the home is foreclosed on, the investor could lose some or in the worst case all of their investment

### Calculations
- The homeowner earns market rate appreciation on their equity
- The investor earns market rate appreciation on the full value of the home
