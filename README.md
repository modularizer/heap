# HEAP - Home Equity Appreciation Partnership
Down Payment Assistance for Homebuyers in exchange for<br/>
Amplified Participation in appreciation of Home Equity for Investor.

## The Contract
#### Basics
* The homebuyer receives a large down payment (e.g. 20% of the home value) from the investor while still paying a smaller down payment (e.g. 7.5%)
* With a cumulative down payment of 27.5%, the homebuyer can afford a mortgage with a lower interest rate and monthly payment
* The investor starts off with the equity of their down payment (20%) and the homebuyer starts off with the equity of their down payment (7.5%)
* As the home appreciates, the homebuyer only receives appreciation on the money they have paid into equity (7.55% + equity payments on their mortgage)
* The investor receives the remainder of the appreciation on the home (the appreciation on their existing equity plus that owned by the bank)
* The homebuyer retains ownership rights and responsibilities of the home with a few minor exceptions
* The homebuyer is responsible for all property taxes, insurance, and maintenance on the home
* The homebuyer OWES NOTHING to the investor (they have no debt to the investor whatsoever, BUT they do not own 100% of the home, even after the mortgage is paid off)
* The investor CANNOT foreclose on the homebuyer or force the homeowner to sell the home

#### Goals
* The homebuyer is able to afford to buy and live in a home they otherwise couldn't afford
* The investor beats the real estate market due to their amplified participation in the appreciation of the home
* The investor gets a comparable return on investment to buying a home and renting it out without the hassle and risk of being a landlord
* The investor is able to help one or more homebuyers afford a home they otherwise couldn't afford
* The contract hopefully has a net positive effect on society and the economy by increasing home ownership rates and reducing wealth inequality
* The contract is a win-win for both parties and is a much better deal than renting for the homebuyer

#### Investor Outcomes
* The investor makes a profit if the home appreciates
  * If the market goes up 4% per year, the investor would make ~8% per year on their investment over the 30 year term
    * In the early years of the contract, the investor would make a much higher percentage than this
    * The average holding period for a home is 13 years, in which time the investor would make ~11% ROI/year if the market goes up 4%/year
    * In the first 13 years, the investor's return on investment would be the same as if they had bought a $160,000 home and rented it out for $1723/month! (the same % ROI of buying a $800,000 home and renting it out for $8615/month!!)
    * Basically, the investor makes MORE than they would as a landlord, but with less hassle and risk and better societal impact

#### Homebuyer Outcomes
* The homebuyer pays ~28% less per month on their mortgage than they would if they had bought the same house without the contract
* Alternatively, the homebuyer can afford a home that is ~25% more expensive than they could otherwise afford (keeping monthly payments the same)
* Alternatively, the homebuyer could buy a home ~10-15% more expensive AND save ~10-15% on their monthly mortgage payment
* Homebuyer gets to feel like they own a home, with fewer restrictions than renting, and the ability to pass on the home to their heirs
* Homebuyer paying a similar monthly rate to renting, but they are building equity in a home and can profit from the appreciation of the home (albeit less than the investor and less than if they owned 100% of the home, but WAY more than if they were renting)

## Details
#### Home Improvement Fund
* In order to ensure the home is maintained, the homebuyer is required to make monthly payments into a Home Improvement Fund 
  * The exact amount is part of the contract and is based on the value of the home and the expected maintenance costs
  * Current guidelines suggest 1% of the home value per year or $1 per square foot per year, but $1/sqft/year is possibly too low and 1% of the home value is possibly too high (especially in areas where the land is worth more than the home)
  * The HIF is jointly owned by the homebuyer and the investor at the same ratio as the equity in the home
  * The HIF can be used for qualifying home maintenance, repairs, and improvements at the discretion of the homebuyer
  * The HIF is split between the homebuyer and the investor when the home is sold according to their equity shares
* Benefits:
  * The HIF is primarily in place to protect the investor's investment from depreciation due to neglect and lack of maintenance
  * Since the homebuyer is buying a home they otherwise couldn't afford, the HIF is a way to ensure that the homebuyer can afford to maintain the home
  * The HIF gets split between the homebuyer and the investor when the home is sold, so the homebuyer is not incentivized to hoard money in the HIF instead of using it on improvements
* The HIF should reduce stresses of home ownership, because if the homeowner takes these costs into account prior to purchase and is forced to save for them, they will be less likely to be surprised by them

#### Liquidity
* The investor cashes out one of three ways:
  * The homebuyer sells the home
  * **The investor sells their contract (rights to the appreciation) to another investor**
    * This is a KEY point of the contract, which enables the investor to cash out and realize their gains at any time
    * The investor DOES NOT HAVE TO WAIT for the homebuyer to sell the home to cash out
    * The homebuyer has the right of first refusal to buy out the investor at the same price as the other investor
    * If the homebuyer does not buy out the investor, the new investor must honor the existing contract
  * The investor sells back some or all of their contract to the homebuyer
* The investor CANNOT force the homebuyer to sell the home
* The investor CAN sell their contract (rights to the appreciation) to another investor
  * HOWEVER, the homebuyer has the right of first refusal to buy out the investor at the same price as the other investor
  * If the homebuyer does not buy out the investor, the new investor must honor the existing contract

#### Cash Flow
* **MOST contracts would not have guaranteed cash flow**, as the homebuyer owes nothing to the investor
* This is accepted by the investor due to the high rate of return on the contract and due to the liquidity of the contract as described above
* The contract behaves more like a stock investment than a rental property investment
* However, some contracts may have cash flow, in the following scenarios...
  * Scheduled buydowns of the investor's equity
    * Certain contracts may allow for or incentivize the homebuyer to buy down the investor's equity over time
    * Similar to making extra monthly payments on a mortgage, this would reduce the investor's equity and increase the homebuyer's equity
    * For the investor this would be similar to dividend payments from a stock and would provide the investor with cash flow
  * Refinancing the home
    * During mortgage refinancing, the homebuyer could potentially buy out some of the investor's equity, providing the investor a partial cash out
  * Rental income
    * Some contracts may allow for the home to be rented out, with the rental income split between the homebuyer and the investor according to their equity shares
    * This would provide the investor with cash flow

#### Ownership Rights
* The homebuyer has the following unrestricted rights
  * The right to live in the home
  * The right to sell the home
  * The right to make "minor" changes to the home
    * interior and exterior paint
    * furniture
    * appliances including washer/dryer, refrigerator, stove, dishwasher, microwave, etc.
    * temporary landscaping with the exception of trees (due to their long term impact on the value of the home)
    * minor repairs including plumbing and electrical
    * minor remodels including flooring, countertops, cabinets, etc.
  * The right to pass on their home to their heirs (with the same contract terms)
  * [Negotiable] The right to buy out [x]% of the investor's share per month at any time a fair market value determined by the price of the home
    * while all details of the contract are theoretically negotiable, this is a key point which may differ from contract to contract
* Right of first refusal on contract sales
  * In the event the investor sells their contract to another investor, the homebuyer has the right of first refusal to buy out the investor at the same price
  * e.g. if the investor wants to sell their contract to another investor for $500k, the homebuyer has the right to buy out the investor at $500k instead
* Potential restrictions:
 * The investor may have the right to approve or disapprove of major changes to the home including
   * remodels
   * additions/tear downs of existing structures
   * long term landscaping including excavation, trees, etc.
   * other permanent or long-term changes that significantly affect the value of the home
 * [Negotiable] Owning >[x] number of dogs/cats/pets
   * while terms of most contracts are negotiable and hopefully very lenient, there may be certain restrictions aimed at reducing significant depreciation of the home and prevent cat lady / hoarder situations
   * e.g. some constract may limit the number of pets to reduce the risk of pet damage to the home (potentially having >3 pets could require approval or negotiations with the investor)
 * [Negotiable] Right to rent the home
  * this may vary from contract to contract and the % of rental income that goes to the investor may vary as well
  * in some contracts, renting the home may not be allowed at all

#### Investor Rights
* The investor has the following rights
  * The right to approve or disapprove of the rental of the home
  * The right to approve or disapprove of major changes to the home
  * The right to request an independent appraisal of the home at any time (at their own expense)
  * The right to sell their contract to another investor at any time (with the homebuyer having the right of first refusal to buy out the investor at the same price instead)
* Right of first refusal on home sales
  * In the event the homebuyer sells the home, the investor has the right of first refusal to buy out the homebuyer at the same price
  * e.g. if the homebuyer wants to sell the home for $1M, the investor has the right to buy out the homebuyer at $1M (minus of course the amount the investor already owns) instead
* [Negotiable] The investor MAY have a right to a percentage of rental income if the home is rented out
  * this may vary from contract to contract and the % of rental income that goes to the investor may vary as well

#### Rental Income
* This would be a key point of negotiation in the contract
* Points of negotiation
  1. Can the home be rented out at all?
    a. Yes, under some contracts the home can be rented out
    b. No, under some contracts the home cannot be rented out. If the home is not the primary residence of the homebuyer, the investor has the right to force the sale of the home
    **c.** Under some contracts, **the home can be rented out, but only with the approval of the investor**
       * This is probably the most common arrangement
  2. How is the rental income split between the homebuyer and the investor?
    a. Under some contracts, the homebuyer keeps 100% of the rental income
       * This might be negotiated by the homebuyer in exchange for accepting a lower down payment from the investor
    **b.** Under some contracts, **the rental income is split** between the homebuyer and the investor according to their equity shares
       * This is probably the most common arrangement
    c. The rental income is split between the homebuyer and the investor according to a different ratio
  3. How long can the home be rented for?
    Certain contracts may allow for rentals but only for a certain period of time before the home may be required to be sold

#### Approval of Major Changes
* The homebuyer must get approval from the investor for major changes to the home
  * Major changes include remodels, additions, and other changes that significantly affect the value of the home
  * If the investor disapproves of the changes, they have the right to request an independent assessment of the proposed changes
* Home Improvement Funds can be used to pay for major changes, with no redistrubution of equity
* In the case the HIF is insufficient to pay for the changes, the remodel can be financed by the homebuyer, the investor, or both
  * If the investor finances the remodel, they may receive a larger share of the appreciation
  * If the homebuyer finances the remodel, they may receive a larger share of the appreciation
  * This redistribution of equity is determined by a third party appraiser

#### Sale of Home
* 60 days (or more) before the home is sold, the homebuyer must notify the investor of their intent to sell
* If the investor is interested in buying out the homebuyer, they have right of first refusal to buy out the homebuyer at the same price as other buyers
* At this point, the investor regains temporary ownership rights of the home, and has the following rights
  * The right to request home improvements/repairs/etc. be made to increase the value of the home
  * Any disputes in how the home is sold are resolved by a third party appraiser
* When accepting an offer on the home, both the homebuyer and the investor must agree to the sale price
  * If the homebuyer and investor cannot agree on the sale price, a third party appraiser determines the sale price
* If there is any leftover money in the Home Improvement Fund, it is split between the homebuyer and the investor according to their equity shares.
  This is intentional so that the homeowner is not incentivized to hoard money in the HIF instead of using it on improvements.
* The investor bears the primary reso=ponsibility for closing costs, realtor fees, and other costs associated with the sale of the home
  * the investor pays `closing_costs * (1 - homeowner_equity)` and the homeowner pays `closing_costs * homeowner_equity`
  * This setup is because it is in the investor's best interest that the home gets sold, seeing as their rate of return generally starts very high and decreases over time

#### Bank Foreclosure
Investors CANNOT foreclose on the homeowner since the homeowner does not owe the investor any money.
However, bank foreclosure is a risk the investor takes in exchange for the potential upside of the contract.
The following is done to reduce that risk:
1. The homebuyer is vetted in a similar manner to how banks vet homebuyers before giving them a mortgage
2. The homebuyer is required to make monthly payments into a Home Improvement Fund to ensure the home is maintained and reduce the chances of it decreasing in value
3. In the event the homebuyer defaults on the mortgage AND the home value is greater than what is owed on the mortgage, the investor is given the right to purchase the home at the current fair market value to prevent the bank from foreclosing on the home
4. In the event the homebuyer defaults on the mortgage AND the home value is less than what is owed on the mortgage (worst case scenario)...
  * the investor must work with the bank to attempt to get the bank to agree to a short sale
  * if the bank agrees to a short sale, the investor is given the right to purchase the home at the current fair market value
  * if the bank does not agree to a short sale, the investor can bid on the home at the foreclosure auction like any other bidder
  * if the investor does not buy the home and it gets forclosed on, it is likely the investor will lose some or all of their investment
5. The investor is able to sell their contract to another investor at any time if they can find a buyer, and the new investor must honor the existing contract


## HEAP Joint Investment Fund
Instead of a single investor, the down payment can be funded by a group of investors, and similarly a single investor can split their investment among multiple homebuyers.

### Advantages
* When spreading out an investment among multiple homes, the risks (defaulting on the mortgage, home fires, home depreciation, etc.) are spread out among multiple homes
* By spreading out an investment among multiple homes, the returns are more predictable and less volatile
* The base contract has an uneven rate of return, with high risks and high reqards at the beginning of the contract, and lower risks and lower rewards at the end of the contract
* By spreading out an investment among multiple homes, the risks and rewards are more evenly distributed over time


## Key points of negotiation
### 1. The "HEAP Payment" amount paid by the investor
  * The ratio of the mortgage amount to the investor's down payment amount determines both the investor's "participation rate" in the real estate market
  * With a high "HEAP Payment", e.g. 40% of the home value, the investor would have a lower participation rate in the real estate market but also lower risks
    * They may only beat the market by 1.5-2x instead of 2-3x, BUT they also have lower downside if the market goes down
    * The homeowner would have a much lower mortgage so presumably more money to spend maintining the home and also a lower risk of defaulting on the mortgage
    * With a high "HEAP Payment", the investor would likely be able to negotiate more favorable terms, such as...
      * A higher percentage of potential rental income
      * Possibly a guaranteed cash flow from the homebuyer buying down the investor's equity
  * With a low "HEAP Payment", e.g. 10% of the home value, the investor would have very high partiticipation rate in the real estate market, but high risks
    * The participation rate applies to both sides, so if the market goes down, the investor would lose a lot of money, but if the market goes up, the investor would make a lot of money
    * The homeowner would have a higher mortgage so presumably less money to spend maintaining the home and also a higher risk of defaulting on the mortgage
    * With a low "HEAP Payment", the investor would likely have to accept less favorable terms, such as...
      * A lower percentage of potential rental income
      * No guaranteed cash flow from the homebuyer buying down the investor's equity
### 2. The down payment paid by the investor
  * Higher required down payments have the effects of
    * Reducing the mortgage amount and thus the monthly payment
    * "proving" the homebuyer's ability to pay the mortgage and maintain the home
    * reducing the risk of foreclosure and/or depreciation due to neglect
  * Higher down payments due reduce the investor's participation rate in the real estate market
    * This is a trade-off the investor must make between risk and reward
    * Basically, the investor is making money off of the appreciation of the bank's share of the home
      * if the bank's share of the home is lower, the investor has a lower upside and a lower downside
  * Lower down payments have some advantages to the investor but also could be a sign of a riskier investment
### 3. Appreciation Ratio
The basic formula is that the investor gets the appreciation on their equity, the homeowner gets the appreciation on their equity, and the investor gets the appreciation on the bank's equity.
However, the appreciation on the bank's equity could be up for negotiation, especially in the case that the homeowner can almost afford the home on their own.
There could be a scenario where the homebuyer puts 15% down and the investor puts 15% down, and the appreciation is split 50/50.

### 4. Homeowner restrictions
  * Homeowner autonomy is a MAJOR selling point of this contract and one of the things that makes it better than renting
  * However, there are some common sense restrictions which homeowners may be more than happy to agree to in order to give investors peace of mind and maybe negotiate better terms. For example
    * no more than 3 pets. VERY negotiable, but if the homeowner is totally fine with this, it may reduce the investor's risk
    * required approval for major changes to the home.
      * This could definitely be a point of negotiation, some investors may be fine with trusting homeowners complete autonomy, while others may want to have a say in major changes
      * Possibly things like modifying walls, adding rooms, etc. could require approval from the investor
      * Use of an excavator or other heavy machinery could be a metric which signals the need for investor approval
      * City permits could also be a metric which signals the need for investor approval
### 5. Rental income
  * This is a key point of negotiation
  * Some investors may want to allow the home to be rented out, while others may not
  * Some investors may want to split the rental income with the homeowner, while others may not
  * Some investors may want to limit the amount of time the home can be rented out, while others may not
  * Some investors may want to require approval for the home to be rented out, while others may not
### 6. Buyout rights
  * The homebuyer may want the right to buy out the investor's share at any time, but the investor may not want to give the homebuyer this right without some restrictions
  * Possibly there would be a cap on the amount of the investor's share that the homebuyer can buy out at any time
  * e.g. the homebuyer can buy out up to 1% of the investor's share per month
  * the buyout rights may be time-based, e.g. after 10 years the homebuyer begins to have the right to buy out the investor's share
  * or maybe buyout rights don't kick in until the homebuyer has paid off the mortgage
### 7. >50% ownership
~18 years into a 30 year mortgage with an initial split of 20% heap, 7.5% down, the investor would own >50% of the home.
This could be a key point of negotiation of if/how the ownership rights change at this point.
Options include:
  1. NOTHING changes, the investor does not gain any additional rights and the rights of the homebuyer remain the same
  2. The investor gains additional rights, such as the right to force the sale of the home (with the alternative of the homebuyer buying out the investor's share)
  3. The homebuyer buys down the investor's equity with monthly payments to keep the ownerhsip's share at <50%
### 8. End of term
Some contracts may have an end of term clause, where the homebuyer must buy out the investor's share at the end of the term.
Possible markes for that clause could be...
1. NEVER, the contract continues indefinitely until the home is sold
2. When the investor's share of the home is >50%
3. When the mortgage is fully paid off
4. After a certain number of years, e.g. 30 years
5. When the homebuyer dies
6. When the homebuyer moves out of the home

Because end of term clauses would typically not be in the best interest of the homebuyer, they could potentially have the deal sweetened by...
* The investor agreeing to certain penalties for invoking the end of term clause
  * e.g. the investor paying all closing costs, realtor fees, and other costs associated with the sale of the home
  * e.g. the investor paying a certain percentage of the appreciation of the home to the homebuyer
* The investor paying a higher initial HEAP payment
* The investor agreeing to a lower percentage of rental income

If the home is purchased as a starter home, the homeowner may be happy to agree to certain end of term clauses in exchange for extra negotiating power in the initial contract.
